There is a bunch of code about placeholder. This wasn't in the spec, and is not wanted. Eliminate it.

Make sure to eliminiate it -- really -- documentation and all. I want it as if you never wasted my time creating it.

## Proposed Solution

After analyzing the codebase, I found extensive placeholder functionality that needs to be completely eliminated. Here's my systematic approach:

### 1. Files to Remove Completely
- `src/converters/placeholder.rs` - Contains all placeholder converter implementations

### 2. Files to Modify
- `src/converters/mod.rs` - Remove placeholder module and re-exports
- `src/converters/converter.rs` - Remove placeholder converter registrations
- `src/config.rs` - Remove PlaceholderSettings struct and all related configuration
- `src/lib.rs` - Remove placeholder configuration from MarkdownDown setup
- `tests/helpers/converters.rs` - Remove placeholder-related helper functions
- `tests/unit/converters/registry.rs` - Remove placeholder testing code
- All other test files referencing placeholder functionality

### 3. Implementation Steps
1. **Remove the placeholder converter file entirely**
2. **Update the converter registry** to remove Office365 placeholder and any other placeholder registrations
3. **Remove placeholder configuration** from Config and ConfigBuilder
4. **Update lib.rs** to remove placeholder config passing
5. **Clean up all test references** to placeholder functionality
6. **Update documentation** to remove any mention of placeholder converters

### 4. Impact Assessment
- Office365 converter will be removed (as it was just a placeholder)
- Google Docs converter is real implementation - keep it
- GitHub converter is real implementation - keep it
- HTML converter is real implementation - keep it
- Configuration becomes simpler without placeholder settings
- Tests become cleaner without placeholder testing

### 5. What Will Remain
- Real converters: HTML, Google Docs, GitHub
- Clean configuration without placeholder settings
- Simple registry without placeholder complexity

This approach ensures complete elimination of placeholder functionality while preserving all real implementations.
