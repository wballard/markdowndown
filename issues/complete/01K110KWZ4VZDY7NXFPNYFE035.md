make sure we can fetch a local file path to a markdown file, with and without file url prefixing

## Status: COMPLETED ✅

This issue has been successfully implemented and tested. The markdowndown library now fully supports fetching local markdown files using both regular file paths and local file URLs.

## Implementation Details

### Features Implemented:
1. **Regular file path support**: `test.md`, `./file.md`, `/path/to/file.md`
2. **Local file URL support**: URLs that reference local files with protocol prefixing
3. **Intelligent path detection**: Distinguishes between domain names and file names
4. **Conservative approach**: Only accepts clear file patterns to avoid false positives

### Key Components:

#### LocalFileConverter (`src/converters/local.rs`)
- Handles both regular file paths and local file URLs
- Normalizes local file URLs to standard paths
- Validates file existence and readability
- Returns proper error messages for missing/invalid files

#### URL Detection (`src/detection.rs`)
- Detects `UrlType::LocalFile` for local paths
- Integrates with `is_local_file_path()` utility function
- Handles normalization of local file URLs

#### Utility Functions (`src/utils.rs`)
- `is_local_file_path()` function with comprehensive detection:
  - Local file URLs with protocol prefix
  - Absolute Unix paths (`/path/to/file`)
  - Relative paths (`./file`, `../file`)
  - Windows paths (`C:\path`, `D:/path`)
  - Simple filenames with extensions (`test.md`, `config.json`)
  - Well-known files without extensions (`Makefile`, `README`)

#### URL Type Validation (`src/types.rs`)
- `Url::new()` accepts both web URLs and local file paths
- Proper error handling for invalid URLs

## Test Results ✅

All tests are passing:
- **Local converter tests**: 9/9 passed
- **Utils tests**: All file path detection tests passed
- **Integration**: Both regular paths and local file URLs work correctly

## Final Status

✅ **Complete** - All requirements have been implemented and tested. The library can successfully fetch local markdown files with and without local file URL prefixing.
